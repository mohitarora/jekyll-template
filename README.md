jekyll-template
===============
This jekyll template repository will be used to generate documentation for all the projects.

Benefits of using jekyll template are:

1. Documentation look and feel of all the projects will be same.
2. Templates will also be version controlled
3. Any Custom plugin created for Jekyll will be available for all the projects to use.


Steps how documentation will be created.

1. During Jenkins Release build, once the release build is complete, jekyll-template directory will be cloned in a temp directory.
2. From the project that is released, documents will be copied into cloned repository. 
3. jekyll build will be run
4. _site directory generated by jekyll will be pushed to Amazon S3 so that documentation can be accessed by public URL.


Pre-requisites

1. Ruby, RubyGem, Jekyll is installed on Jenkins machine (gem install jekyll --no-ri --no-rdoc)
2. DNS Name to S3 Bucket mapping is already done (if required)
